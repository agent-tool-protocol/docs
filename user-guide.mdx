## Connecting Integrations

Integrations connect your AI agents to external services and APIs. ChatATP supports both OAuth-based integrations and custom API key connections.

### Connecting Pre-built Integrations (OAuth)

Many popular services offer one-click OAuth integration:

3. **OAuth Flow**:
   - Click "Connect" on the integration
   - Sign in to the service (if not already)
   - Grant ChatATP the requested permissions
   - Return to ChatATP (connection is saved)

![image-placeholder: OAuth Integration Flow]

4. **Verify Connection**: Check "Connected Accounts" to see active integrations

<Note>
  OAuth integrations automatically handle token refresh and security, so you don't need to worry about API keys expiring.
</Note>

### Connecting Custom Integrations (API Keys)

For services that don't support OAuth or custom integrations:

1. **Get Your API Key**: Obtain the API key from the service's developer dashboard

2. **Add Integration**:
   - Go to "Integrations" → "Custom Integrations"
   - Click "Add Custom Integration"
   - Enter the service name and API key
   - Choose the appropriate authentication type

3. **Test Connection**: ChatATP will verify the API key works correctly

### Managing Connected Accounts

Keep your integrations organized and secure:

- **Test Connections**: Verify integrations are working properly
- **Revoke Access**: Disconnect services you no longer need
- **Update Permissions**: Modify what each integration can access

<Warning>
  Regularly review your connected accounts and revoke access for services you no longer use.
