# Managing Agents

Agents are the core of the ATP platform. Learn how to create, configure, and manage your intelligent agents to automate tasks and workflows.

## Creating Your First Agent

### Step 1: Agent Setup

1. From the ATP dashboard, click **"Create Agent"**
2. Choose a descriptive name for your agent
3. Select the primary use case or category
4. Choose your preferred LLM provider

### Step 2: Configure Capabilities

1. **Attach integrations**: Connect OAuth and custom integrations
2. **Install toolkits**: Add pre-built tool collections
3. **Set permissions**: Define what the agent can access
4. **Configure personality**: Set the agent's communication style

### Step 3: Test and Deploy

1. **Test in sandbox**: Verify agent behavior safely
2. **Review responses**: Ensure outputs meet your expectations
3. **Deploy to production**: Make the agent available to users

## Agent Dashboard

Monitor and manage all your agents from the central dashboard:

- **Status indicators**: See which agents are active/inactive
- **Performance metrics**: Track usage and response times
- **Usage logs**: Review agent interactions and decisions
- **Error monitoring**: Identify and resolve issues

## Agent Configuration Options

### Basic Settings

- **Name and description**: Agent identity and purpose
- **LLM model**: Choose the underlying language model
- **Temperature**: Control response creativity vs consistency
- **Max tokens**: Limit response length

### Advanced Settings

- **System prompts**: Define agent behavior and knowledge
- **Tool restrictions**: Limit which tools the agent can use
- **Rate limiting**: Control how often the agent can be called
- **Logging level**: Adjust verbosity of activity logs

## Managing Multiple Agents

### Organization Strategies

- **Use naming conventions** for easy identification
- **Group related agents** into projects or teams
- **Set up agent hierarchies** for complex workflows
- **Implement approval workflows** for critical agents

### Collaboration Features

- **Share agents** with team members
- **Transfer ownership** when needed
- **Clone agents** to create variations
- **Version control** agent configurations

## Agent Lifecycle Management

### Development Phase

1. **Prototype** with basic configurations
2. **Test** in controlled environments
3. **Iterate** based on feedback and performance
4. **Document** agent capabilities and limitations

### Production Phase

1. **Monitor** performance and usage patterns
2. **Update** configurations as requirements evolve
3. **Scale** resources based on demand
4. **Retire** agents that are no longer needed

### Maintenance Tasks

- **Regular health checks** of agent functionality
- **Security updates** for integrations and toolkits
- **Performance optimization** based on usage data
- **User feedback integration** for continuous improvement

## Troubleshooting Agent Issues

### Common Problems

- **Poor response quality**: Adjust system prompts or model settings
- **Integration failures**: Verify credentials and permissions
- **Performance issues**: Check rate limits and resource usage
- **Unexpected behavior**: Review recent changes and logs

### Debugging Tools

- **View execution logs** for detailed error information
- **Test individual tools** in isolation
- **Use debug mode** for step-by-step execution
- **Analyze conversation history** for pattern identification

## Agent Analytics

Track your agents' performance with built-in analytics:

- **Usage statistics**: Number of interactions and active users
- **Response metrics**: Success rates and average response times
- **Error tracking**: Common failure points and resolution rates
- **Cost analysis**: API usage and associated costs
