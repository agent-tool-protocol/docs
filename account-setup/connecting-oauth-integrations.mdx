# Connecting OAuth Integrations

OAuth integrations allow your agents to securely access external services and APIs without exposing sensitive credentials.

## Supported OAuth Providers

ATP supports OAuth integration with popular business platforms:

- **Salesforce** - Access CRM data and sales information
- **HubSpot** - Marketing and sales automation data
- **Slack** - Team communication and notifications
- **Google Workspace** - Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Sheets
- **Microsoft 365** - Outlook, Teams, OneDrive
- **Notion** - Workspace and knowledge base access
- **Airtable** - Database and spreadsheet operations

## Setting Up OAuth Integration

### Step 1: Register OAuth Application

1. Go to your target service's developer console
2. Create a new OAuth application
3. Set the redirect URI to: `https://platform.chat-atp.com/oauth/callback`

### Step 2: Configure in ATP

1. In ATP Platform, go to **Settings** > **OAuth Integrations**
2. Click **"Add Integration"**
3. Select your service from the list
4. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret from your OAuth app

### Step 3: Authorize Access

1. Click **"Connect"** to start the OAuth flow
2. You'll be redirected to the service's authorization page
3. Grant the requested permissions
4. Return to ATP Platform - integration is now active

## Managing Permissions

Each integration requires specific permissions (scopes):

- **Read-only**: View data without modifications
- **Read/Write**: Full access to create, update, and delete
- **Admin**: Access to user management and settings

Review and approve the requested scopes during authorization.

## Integration Status

Monitor your integrations in the ATP dashboard:

- **Active**: Successfully connected and working
- **Error**: Authentication issues or expired tokens
- **Pending**: Awaiting re-authorization

## Revoking Access

To disconnect an integration:

1. Go to **Settings** > **OAuth Integrations**
2. Find the integration and click **"Revoke"**
3. Confirm the disconnection
4. Optionally delete the OAuth app from the service's console

## Next Steps

With OAuth integrations configured, you can now [add custom integrations](/account-setup/adding-custom-integrations) for services that don't support OAuth.
