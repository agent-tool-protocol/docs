# Connecting OAuth Integrations

OAuth integrations allow your agents to securely access external services and APIs without exposing sensitive credentials.

## Supported OAuth Providers

- **Asana** - Project and task management
- **Linear** - Project and task management

### Step 2: Authorize Access

1. Click the connect button for the OAuth service you want to connect to start the authorization flow, such as Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Notion, Airtable, Asana, Linear, or Atlassian Jira from the App Marketplace
2. You'll be redirected to the service's authorization page
3. Grant the requested permissions
4. You will be redirected back to ChatATP

## Managing Permissions

Each integration requires specific permissions (scopes):

- **Read-only**: View data without modifications
- **Read/Write**: Full access to create, update, and delete
- **Admin**: Access to user management and settings

Review and approve the requested scopes during authorization.

## Integration Status

Monitor your integrations in the ChatATP Account Section:

- **Active**: Successfully connected and working
- **Error**: Authentication issues or expired tokens
- **Pending**: Awaiting re-authorization

## Revoking Access

To disconnect an integration:

1. Go to Account > Tap on Integrations Tab
2. Find the integration and click **"Disconnect"**
3. Confirm the disconnection

## Next Steps

With OAuth integrations configured, you can now [add custom integrations](/account-setup/adding-custom-integrations) for services that don't support OAuth.
